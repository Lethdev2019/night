Dynamic squid, can i ask you not to change the format, otherwise i will not be able to add a search

plus searches are meant to be easy to access, not just on one page. (plus it does support the titlebar to have links so please stop.)
Also, search works now but only for the page name. Oh, it also needs to be updated manually.

jeez, this is taking a long time for one page. BUT it looks good AND it is responsive.
